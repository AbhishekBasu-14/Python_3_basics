#Beginner Topic 1 - Python Print function, String and Variables.

a=10
b=20
c=16
#Various parameters can be passed in print() as shown the commands below.
print("Examples of mathematical operations :-")
print(a+b+70) #mathematical operations can be performed.
print(a+0.7) #integer and float number can be directly added.
print(c/a) #this gives the floated value after division.
print(c//a) #this gives the floored int value after division.
print(2**3) #power ** function a**b means a to the power b.
print(b%a) #b%a modulus % function gives the remainder when b is divided by a.
print(b%3) #another example of modulus.
print("")

#Solving complex equations
print("Mathematical equations can be solved in 2 ways: 1. using a variable 2. direct method (not preferred)")
c=(a+(b**2))/20
#here, we are printing a variable, so TYPECASTING has to be done to convert data type of c from int(or float) to str().
print("Using method 1, the answer is "+str(c)) #using + does not add a space automatically before the answer.

#The same expression can be directly evaluated under print()
print("Using method 2, the answer is",(a+(b**2))/20) #using a comma will automatically add a <space> before the evaluated answer.
print("")

#for printing a string multiple times, we can use the * command
s="Yo"
print("Yo"*7) #This will print Yo 7 times.
print("")

#use of input()
#This is used to TAKE USER INPUT.
#While running the code, this part will ask for user input for further execution.
n=input("Whats your name ? ") #by default, string is the data type when we use input() 
a=int(input("Whats your age ? ")) #here, input() has been typecasted to int since age has to be a integer. 
h=float(input("Whats your height ? ")) #same has been done for height. If invalid input is given, we get a ValueError
print("Name is "+n)
print("Age is "+str(a)+" years old")
print("Height is "+str(h))
