#Importing modules

#ASSUME math() was NOT an inbuilt function.
import math
a=5
b=6
c= math.pow(a,b) #pow() is defined in the math() module which is an existing file.
print("We have assumed math() as not to be an inbuilt function, so we imported it and used math.pow()")
print("a raised to b using pow() is",c)
print(" ")

#Similarly other modules can be created and used by following the steps given in the above text cell.

#Renaming a module
#Lets rename module math() as m() and see the working.
import math as m
a=5
b=6
c= m.pow(a,b) #we use m.pow() directly.
print("We have renamed module math () as m(). The result obtained remains same.")
print("a raised to b using pow() is",c)
print(" ")

#dir() will show all the available functions in math() module
import math
x = dir(math)
print("All available functions under math module are as follows ")
print(x)
print("")

#Import from module
#Example is shown in text cell above. We can't run it here as we have not saved the mymodule.py file
